# Project Goals
Data Ingestion: Develop a system to collect data from multiple sources efficiently.
saas
ETL Process: Convert raw data into a structured format through extraction, transformation, and loading.
Data Lake: Establish a centralized repository to store data from various sources for easy access and management.
Scalability: Ensure the system can handle increasing data volumes without performance issues.
Cloud Integration: Leverage AWS for large-scale data processing, eliminating local computing limitations.

# Dataset Used

This Kaggle dataset includes statistics (CSV files) on daily trending YouTube videos over several months. Each day, up to 200 popular videos from various regions are recorded, with separate files for each region. The dataset contains details such as video title, channel title, publication time, tags, views, likes, dislikes, description, and comment count. Additionally, each regionâ€™s data includes a category_id field, which varies by location, along with a linked JSON file.
